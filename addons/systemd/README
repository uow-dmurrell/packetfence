pfconfig.service and packetfence.service must go to /usr/lib/systemd/system/

When manipulating service on cent os 7 we need to exclusively use systemctl start/stop/status/restart your-service to avoid issues
If you use the old centos6 way, your services might not start and stop properly

Also to replace the chkconfig on centos7 you need to use
systemctl enable your-service

Inside the unit pfconfig.service or packetfence.service it going in 3 blocks:
Unit (Description, Start After or Before)
Service (Type of process, what to exec in Start, Stop or Post/Pre Start/Stop, setup auto restart, and multiple others options)
Install(This section is for the enable/disable command, where will it be install)
