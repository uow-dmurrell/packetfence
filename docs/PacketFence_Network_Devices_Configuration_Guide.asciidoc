About this Guide
----------------

This guide covers the configuration of network devices in order to integrate 
them with PacketFence in VLAN enforcement. Switches, wireless controllers and 
wireless access points are all considered network devices in PacketFence's 
terms.

The latest version of this guide is available at http://www.packetfence.org/documentation/

Note on Inline enforcement support
----------------------------------

There is no need to follow the instructions in this guide if you plan on deploying in inline 
enforcement, except RADIUS inline. In this case all you need to do is to have a flat layer 2 network up to 
PacketFence's inline interface with no other gateway available for devices to reach out to the 
Internet. 

This technique is usually used when your network hardware doesn't support VLAN 
enforcement. 

List of supported Network Devices
---------------------------------

PacketFence supports a whole lot of different wireless and wired network equipments from various vendors running 
different versions. Since we want to provide the most accurate information and avoid duplication of that same 
information, please refer to our website http://www.packetfence.org/about/supported_switches_and_aps.html

You'll find on this page the enforcement modes supported by each and every single piece of equipment we tested and 
worked with. 

Switch configuration
--------------------

PacketFence supports these 3Com switches with the following techniques:

* 802.1X with MAC Authentication fallback
* linkUp/linkDown (not recommended)

Voice over IP support was not explicitly tested during implementation however 
it does not mean that it won't work.

NJ220 
^^^^^

This switch does not support port-security. 

To configure: use web interface to send the linkUp/linkDown traps to the PacketFence server. 

Alcatel
~~~~~~~

OS6250, OS6450 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence supports this switch using 802.1x, Mac authentication and also supports VoIP.

Global configuration
++++++++++++++++++++

First define any VLAN that you want to use on the switch.

    vlan 2
    vlan 5
    vlan 20
    vlan 100

Next, configure the RADIUS server to be PacketFence

    aaa radius-server "packetfence" host 192.168.1.5 key useStrongerSecret
    aaa authentication mac packetfence
    aaa authentication 802.1x packetfence

You now need to configure a user profile (equivalent of a role) that will determine which VLAN is assigned to the device. In this case the profile names are 'unreg', 'employee' and 'guest'.

    aaa user-network-profile name unreg vlan 2
    aaa user-network-profile name guest vlan 5
    aaa user-network-profile name employee vlan 20

Next, configure the switch in PacketFence. In the case of this example, the uplink is port 1/1.
 
    [192.168.1.10]
    mode=production
    description=alcatel
    type=Alcatel
    radiusSecret=useStrongerSecret
    uplink_dynamic=0
    uplink=1001
    RoleMap=Y
    VlanMap=N
    registrationRole=unreg
    isolationRole=unreg
    defaultRole=employee
    guestRole=guest

802.1x
++++++

First, make sure you followed the steps above in 'Global configuration'

You will need to configure the ports you want to do authentication on.

    vlan port mobile 1/2
    vlan port 1/2 802.1x enable
    802.1x 1/2 supplicant policy authentication pass group-mobility block fail block
    802.1x 1/2 non-supplicant policy authentication pass group-mobility block fail block

Mac Authentication
++++++++++++++++++

First, make sure you followed the steps above in 'Global configuration' and '802.1x'

Next configure the interface to bypass 802.1x authentication

    802.1x 1/2 supplicant bypass enable

VoIP
++++

PacketFence supports VoIP on Alcatel by having multiple devices using multiple untagged VLANs on the same port.

First configure the user profile for voice. In this example it is only isolating it on another VLAN but any user profile attributes can be added to the profile.

    aaa user-network-profile name voice vlan 3

Next, make sure you enable VoIP in the switch configuration in PacketFence and configure the voiceRole.

    [192.168.1.10]
    VoIPEnabled=Y
    voiceRole=voice


OS6860
^^^^^^

PacketFence supports this switch using 802.1x, Mac authentication and also supports VoIP.

NOTE: This documentation is made for Alcatel OS 8.1+. Lower versions do not support this configuration.

Global configuration
++++++++++++++++++++

First define any VLAN that you want to use on the switch.

    vlan 2 admin-state enable
    vlan 5 admin-state enable
    vlan 20 admin-state enable
    vlan 100 admin-state enable

Next, configure the RADIUS server to be PacketFence

    aaa radius-server "packetfence" host 192.168.1.5 key useStrongerSecret
    aaa device-authentication mac packetfence
    aaa device-authentication 802.1x packetfence

You now need to configure an edge profile (equivalent of a role) that will determine which VLAN is assigned to the device. In this case the profile names are 'unreg', 'employee' and 'guest'.


    unp edge-profile unreg
    unp edge-profile unreg redirect enable
    unp edge-profile unreg authentication-flag enable
    unp vlan-mapping edge-profile unreg vlan 2

    unp edge-profile guest
    unp edge-profile guest redirect enable
    unp edge-profile guest authentication-flag enable
    unp vlan-mapping edge-profile guest vlan 5

    unp edge-profile employee
    unp edge-profile employee redirect enable
    unp edge-profile employee authentication-flag enable
    unp vlan-mapping edge-profile employee vlan 20

CAUTION: Make sure you enable the redirect on *all* your roles as the access reevaluation will not work without it.

Next, configure the switch in PacketFence. In the case of this example, the uplink is port 1/1/1.
 
    [192.168.1.10]
    mode=production
    description=alcatel
    type=Alcatel
    radiusSecret=useStrongerSecret
    uplink_dynamic=0
    uplink=1001
    RoleMap=Y
    VlanMap=N
    registrationRole=unreg
    isolationRole=unreg
    defaultRole=employee
    guestRole=guest

Mac Authentication
++++++++++++++++++

First, make sure you followed the steps above in 'Global configuration'

You will need to create an edge template and apply it on the ports you want to do authentication on.

    unp edge-template pf_mab
    unp edge-template pf_mab mac-authentication enable
    unp edge-template pf_mab classification enable
    unp port 1/1/2 port-type edge
    unp port 1/1/2 edge-template pf_mab

802.1x
++++++

First, make sure you followed the steps above in 'Global configuration'

You will need to create an edge template and apply it on the ports you want to do authentication on.

    unp edge-template pf_dot1x
    unp edge-template pf_dot1x 802.1x-authentication enable
    unp edge-template pf_dot1x mac-authentication enable
    unp edge-template pf_dot1x 802.1x-authentication failure-policy mac-authentication
    unp port 1/1/2 port-type edge
    unp port 1/1/2 edge-template pf_dot1x

VoIP
++++

PacketFence supports VoIP on Alcatel by having multiple devices using multiple untagged VLANs on the same port.

First configure the edge profile for voice. In this example it is only isolating it on another VLAN but any edge profile attributes can be added to the profile.

    unp edge-profile voice
    unp edge-profile voice redirect enable
    unp edge-profile voice authentication-flag enable
    unp vlan-mapping edge-profile voice vlan 100

Next, make sure you enable VoIP in the switch configuration in PacketFence and configure the voiceRole.

    [192.168.1.10]
    VoIPEnabled=Y
    voiceRole=voice


AlliedTelesis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

AT8000GS
^^^^^^^^

PacketFence supports the AT8000GS switch using :

* Mac Authentication (mac-only)
* 802.1X

VoIP support is limited using 802.1X/MAC authentication.  We do have a limitation where the phone needs to be on the same VLAN as the PC (no voice VLAN concept).

Mac Authentication
++++++++++++++++++

First, activate 802.1X globally:

   dot1x system-auth-control

Next, configure the RADIUS server and AAA settings:

   radius-server host 10.0.0.100               
   radius-server key qwerty
   radius-server source-ip 10.0.0.14
   aaa authentication dot1x default radius 
   aaa accounting dot1x radius

In order to get mac authentication, you need to enable the guest VLAN globally: 

   interface vlan 5
   name "Guest Vlan"
   dot1x guest-vlan
   exit

Finally, enable the necessary 802.1X settings for mac-only authentication:

   interface ethernet g1
   dot1x mac-authentication mac-only
   dot1x radius-attributes vlan                
   dot1x port-control auto
   dot1x guest-vlan enable


802.1X
++++++

The settings are almost the same as the MAC Authentication with some small differences.

First, activate 802.1X globally:

   dot1x system-auth-control

Next, configure the RADIUS server and AAA settings:

   radius-server host 10.0.0.100
   radius-server key qwerty
   radius-server source-ip 10.0.0.14
   aaa authentication dot1x default radius
   aaa accounting dot1x radius

Finally, enable the necessary 802.1X settings:

   interface ethernet g1    
   dot1x radius-attributes vlan
   dot1x port-control auto

Amer 
~~~~

PacketFence supports Amer switches _without VoIP_ using one trap type: 

* linkUp/linkDown 

Don't forget to update the startup config! 

L2 Switch SS2R24i 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Global config settings:

  create snmp host 192.168.1.5 v2c public 
  create snmp user public ReadGroup 
  enable snmp traps 

On each interface: 

  config vlan default delete xx 
  config vlan mac-detection add untagged xx 

where `xx` stands for the interface index 

Avaya 
~~~~~

Avaya bought Nortel's wired networks assets. So Avaya switches are, in effect, re-branded 
Nortels. See <<_nortel,Nortel section>> of this document for configuration instructions. 

Brocade
~~~~~~~

ICX 6400 Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Those switches are supported using 802.1X for networks with or without VoIP.

* Global config settings:

  aaa authentication dot1x default radius
  radius-server host 192.168.1.5 auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813 default
  radius-server key useStrongerSecret

  vlan 1 name DEFAULT-VLAN by port
  !
  vlan 100 by port
   tagged ethe 1/1/xx ethe 1/1/yy

Where `xx` and `yy` represent the range of ports where you want PacketFence
enforcement.

MAC-Authentication without VoIP
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Enable MAC-Authentication globally

  mac-authentication enable
  mac-authentication mac-vlan-dyn-activation

* Enable MAC-Authentication on each interface you want PacketFence active

   mac-authentication enable
   mac-authentication enable-dynamic-vlan

MAC-Authentication with VoIP
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Enable cdp globally

  cdp run

* Apply the following configuration on each interface you want PacketFence active

   dual-mode
   mac-authentication enable
   mac-authentication enable-dynamic-vlan
   voice-vlan 100
   cdp enable

802.1X/MAC-Auth
+++++++++++++++

* Enable 802.1X globally

  dot1x-enable
   re-authentication
   enable ethe 1/1/xx

Where `xx` is the switch port number

* Apply the following configuration on each interface you want PacketFence active

   dot1x port-control auto
   dual-mode
   mac-authentication enable
   mac-authentication enable-dynamic-vlan
   voice-vlan 100


Cisco
~~~~~

PacketFence supports Cisco switches with VoIP using three different trap types: 

* linkUp/linkDown 
* MAC Notification 
* Port Security (with static MACs) 

You also need to make sure that lldp or cdp notification is configured on all ports that will handle VoIP.

On some recent models, we can also use more secure and robust features like: 

* MAC Authentication (Cisco's MAC Authentication Bypass or MAB) 
* 802.1X (Multi-Host or Multi-Domain) 

Depending of the switch model, we recommend the use of the most secure and reliable feature 
first. In other words, you should consider the following order:

. 802.1X/MAB 
. Port-Security 
. linkUp/linkDown 

2900XL / 3500XL Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SNMP | linkUP/linkDown
++++++++++++++++++++++

Global config settings: 

  snmp-server community public RO
  snmp-server community private RW
  snmp-server enable traps snmp linkdown linkup 
  snmp-server enable traps mac-notification 
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 trap version 2c public snmp mac-notification 
  mac-address-table notification interval 0 
  mac-address-table notification 
  mac-address-table aging-time 3600 

On each interface _without VoIP_: 

  switchport mode access 
  switchport access vlan 4 
  snmp trap mac-notification added 

On each interface _with VoIP_:

  switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q 
  switchport trunk native vlan 4 
  switchport mode trunk 
  switchport voice vlan 100 
  snmp trap mac-notification added 
  snmp trap mac-notification removed 

2950
^^^^

Those switches are now supported using 802.1X for networks with or without VoIP. 
You can also use port-security with static MAC address but we can not secure 
a MAC on the data VLAN specifically so enable it if there is no VoIP, use 
linkUp/linkDown and MAC notification otherwise.So on setup that needs to 
handle VoIP with this switch, go with a 802.1X configuration. 

802.1X
++++++

[WARNING]
====
Make sure that you have a local account, because enabling 802.1X or MAB will ask for a username and password on the next login.

Global config settings:

  dot1x system-auth-control

  aaa authorization network default group packetfence 

RADIUS server configuration:

  radius-server host 192.168.1.5 auth-port 1812 acct-port 1813 timeout 2 
  key useStrongerSecret 
  radius-server vsa send authentication 

On each interface _without VoIP_:

  switchport access vlan 4 
  switchport mode access 
  dot1x port-control auto 
  dot1x host-mode multi-host 
  dot1x reauthentication 

On each interface _with VoIP_:

  switchport access vlan 4 
  switchport mode access 
  switchport voice vlan 100 
  dot1x port-control auto 
  dot1x host-mode multi-host 
  dot1x reauthentication 

Port-Security 
+++++++++++++

CAUTION: With port-security, if no MAC is connected on ports when activating port-security, we need 
to secure bogus MAC addresses on ports in order for the switch to send a trap when a new 
MAC appears on a port. On the other hand, if a MAC is actually connected when you enable 
port security, you must secure this MAC rather than the bogus one. Otherwise this MAC will 
lose its connectivity instantly. 

Global config settings _without VoIP_:

  snmp-server enable traps port-security 
  snmp-server enable traps port-security trap-rate 1 
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 version 2c public port-security 

On each interface _without VoIP_:

  switchport mode access 
  switchport access vlan 4 
  switchport port-security 
  switchport port-security violation restrict 
  switchport port-security mac-address 0200.0000.00xx

Port­Security for IOS 12.2(46)SE or greater
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Since version PacketFence 2.2.1, the way to handle VoIP when using 
port-security dramatically changed. Ensure that you follow the instructions 
below. To make the story short, instead on relying on the dynamic 
MAC learning for VoIP, we use a static entry on the voice VLAN so we can trigger a new security 
violation, and then authorize the phone MAC address on the network. 

Global config settings:

  snmp-server community public RO
  snmp-server community private RW
  snmp-server enable traps port-security 
  snmp-server enable traps port-security trap-rate 1 
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 version 2c public port-security 

On each interface _without VoIP_:

  switchport access vlan 4 
  switchport port-security 
  switchport port-security maximum 1 vlan access 
  switchport port-security violation restrict 
  switchport port-security mac-address 0200.000x.xxxx 

where `xxxxx` stands for the interface `ifIndex`

On each interface _with VoIP_: 

  switchport voice vlan 100 
  switchport access vlan 4 
  switchport port-security 
  switchport port-security maximum 2 
  switchport port-security maximum 1 vlan access 
  switchport port-security maximum 1 vlan voice 
  switchport port-security violation restrict 
  switchport port-security mac-address 0200.010x.xxxx vlan voice 
  switchport port-security mac-address 0200.000x.xxxx vlan access 

where `xxxxx` stands for the interface `ifIndex` 

[NOTE]
.ifIndex mapping
===========================================================================
Use the following templates for interface `IfIndex` in bogus MAC addresses
(0200.000x.xxxx):

* Fa0/1...Fa0/48 -> 10001...10048 
* Gi0/1...Gi0/48 -> 10101...10148

Web auth
++++++++

The Catalyst 2960 supports web authentication from IOS 12.2.55SE3. This procedure has been tested on IOS 15.0.2SE5.

In this example, the ACL that trigger the redirection to the portal for registration is 'registration'.

Configure the global configuration of the switch using the section __MAC Authentication bypass only__ of the 2960 in this document.

Then add this additionnal configuration on the global level

  ip dhcp snooping
  ip device tracking
  nmsp enable
  udld enable
  ip http server
  ip http secure-server
  snmp-server community public RO
  snmp-server community private RW

Add the required access lists

  ip access-list extended registration
   deny ip any host <your captive portal ip> 
   permit tcp any any eq www
   permit tcp any any eq 443

Then on each controlled interface

   switchport access vlan <vlan> 
   switchport mode access
   authentication priority mab
   authentication port-control auto
   authentication periodic
   mab
   spanning-tree portfast

PacketFence switch configuration 

* Select the type to 'Cisco Catalyst 2960 with Web Auth'
* Set Role by Url for registration to 'http://<your_captive_portal_ip>'
* Screenshots of this configuration are available in the Cisco WLC section of this guide.

Downloadable ACLs
+++++++++++++++++

The Catalyst 2960 supports RADIUS pushed ACLs which means that you can define the ACLs centrally in PacketFence without configuring them in your switches and their rules will be applied to the switch during the authentication.

These ACLs are defined by role like the VLANs which means you can define different ACLs for your registration VLAN, production VLAN, guest VLAN, etc.

Add the following configuration setting on the global level 

   ip device tracking

Before continuing, configure your switch to be in MAC authentication bypass or 802.1X.

Now in the PacketFence interface go in the switch configuration and in the Roles tab.

Check 'Role by access list' and you should now be able to configure the access lists as below.

For example if you want the users that are in the registration VLAN to only use HTTP, HTTPS, DNS and DHCP you can configure this ACL in the registration category.

image::docs/images/cisco-downloadable-acl-reg.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Registration ACL"]

Now if for example, your normal users are placed in the 'default' category and your guests in the 'guest' category.

If for example the 'default' category uses the network 192.168.5.0/24 and your guest network uses the network 192.168.10.0/24.

You can prevent communications between both networks using these access lists

image::docs/images/cisco-downloadable-acl-cross-network.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Cross network deny ACL"]

You could also only prevent your guest users from using shared directories

image::docs/images/cisco-downloadable-acl-deny-shares.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Deny shares ACL"]

Or also you could restrict your users to use only your DNS server where 192.168.5.2 is your DNS server

image::docs/images/cisco-downloadable-acl-force-dns.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Force DNS ACL"]


Web auth and Downloadable ACLs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's possible to mix web authentication and downloadable ACLs starting from the IOS version 15.2, for example if you want to be able to redirect the device to the captive portal when a violation is triggered.
To do that first you need to configure PacketFence with Role by Url and with Role by access list (For each role you need).
On the switch you need to change the Auth-Default-ACL to add the portal ip address:

  Extended IP access list Auth-Default-ACL
      10 permit udp any any eq domain
      20 permit tcp any any eq domain
      30 permit udp any eq bootps any
      40 permit udp any any eq bootpc
      50 permit udp any eq bootpc any
      60 deny ip any any

  conf t
  ip access-list extend  Auth-Default-ACL
  51 permit ip any host ip_of_the_captiv_portal


Stacked 29xx, Stacked 35xx, Stacked 3750, 4500 Series, 6500 Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 4500 Series and all the stacked switches work exactly the same way as if they were not stacked so the configuration is the same: they support port-security with static MAC address and allow us to secure a MAC on the data VLAN so we enable it whether there is VoIP or not. 

We need to secure bogus MAC addresses on ports in order for the switch to send a trap when a new MAC appears on a port. 

Global config settings 

  snmp-server community public RO
  snmp-server community private RW
  snmp-server enable traps port-security 
  snmp-server enable traps port-security trap-rate 1 
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 version 2c public port-security 

On each interface _without VoIP_: 

  switchport access vlan 4 
  switchport port-security 
  switchport port-security maximum 1 vlan access 
  switchport port-security violation restrict 
  switchport port-security mac-address 0200.000x.xxxx

802.1X only
+++++++++++

Follow the same configuration as for MAC Authentication Bypass but change the `authentication priority` line with the following: 

  authentication priority dot1x

802.1X with Mac Authentication fallback
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Follow the same configuration as for MAC Authentication Bypass but change the `authentication priority` line with the following:

  authentication priority dot1x mab

Web auth
++++++++

Web auth requires at least MAC Authentication Bypass to be activated on the switchport but can also work with 802.1X. Configure your switchports as you would usually do, then add the following access lists.

  ip access-list extended redirect
   deny   ip any host 192.168.1.5
   deny   udp any any eq domain
   deny   tcp any any eq domain
   deny   udp any any eq bootpc
   deny   udp any any eq bootps
   permit tcp any any eq www
   permit tcp any any eq 443
  ip access-list extended registered
   permit ip any any

PacketFence switch configuration:

* Select the type to 'Cisco Catalyst 2960 with Web Auth'
* Set Role by Url for registration to 'http://<your_captive_portal_ip>'
* Screenshots of this configuration are available in the Cisco WLC section of this guide.

NOTE: AAA authentication is slow to come up after a reload of the IOS XE switches. This makes the recovery from a reboot longer to complete. This is due to a bug in IOS XE. A workaround is to execute the following command `no aaa accounting system default start-stop group tacacs+`.

Router ISR 1800 Series 
++++++++++++++++++++++

PacketFence supports the 1800 series Router with linkUp / linkDown traps. It cannot do 
anything about the router interfaces (ie: fa0 and fa1 on a 1811). VLAN interfaces `ifIndex` should 
also be marked as uplinks in the PacketFence switch configuration as they generate traps but 
are of no interest to PacketFence (layer 3). 

Global config settings: 

  snmp-server enable traps snmp linkdown linkup 
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 trap version 2c public 

On each interface: 

  switchport mode access 
  switchport access vlan 4 

D-Link
~~~~~~

PacketFence supports D-Link switches without VoIP using two different trap types: 

* linkUp/linkDown 
* MAC Notification 

*We recommend to enable linkUp/linkDown and MAC notification together.*

PacketFence supports Enterasys switches _without VoIP_ using two different trap types: 

* linkUp/linkDown 
* MAC Locking (Port Security with static MACs) 

*We recommend to enable MAC locking only.*

Don't forget to update the startup config! 

Matrix N3 
^^^^^^^^^

linkUp/linkDown traps are enabled by default so we disable them and enable MAC locking 
only. Also, by default this switch doesn't do an electrical low-level linkDown when setting the 
port to admin down. So we need to activate a global option called `forcelinkdown` to enable 
this behaviour. Without this option, clients don't understand that they lost their connection and 
they never do a new DHCP on VLAN change. 

Global config settings 

  set snmp community public 
  set snmp targetparams v2cPF user public security-model v2c message-processing v2c 
  set snmp notify entryPF tag TrapPF 
  set snmp targetaddr tr 192.168.1.5 param v2cPF taglist TrapPF 
  set maclock enable 
  set forcelinkdown enable 

On each interface: 

  set port trap ge.1.xx disable 
  set maclock enable ge.1.xx 
  set maclock static ge.1.xx 1 
  set maclock firstarrival ge.1.xx 0 
  set maclock trap ge.1.xx enable 

where `xx` stands for the interface index.

SecureStack C2 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

linkUp/linkDown traps are enabled by default so we disable them and enable MAC locking 
only. 

Global config settings 

  set snmp community public 
  set snmp targetparams v2cPF user public security-model v2c message-processing v2c

  set maclock enable 

On each interface: 

  set port trap fe.1.xx disable 
  set maclock enable fe.1.xx 
  set maclock static fe.1.xx 1 
  set maclock firstarrival fe.1.xx 0 

where `xx` stands for the interface index 

SecureStack C3 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This switch has the particular _feature_ of allowing more than one untagged egress VLAN per 
port. This means that you must add all the VLAN created for PacketFence as untagged egress 
VLAN on the relevant interfaces. This is why there is a VLAN command on each interface 
below. 

linkUp/linkDown traps are enabled by default so we disable them and enable MAC locking 
only. 

Global config settings

  set snmp targetparams v2cPF user public security-model v2c message-processing v2c 
  set snmp notify entryPF tag TrapPF 
  set snmp targetaddr tr 192.168.1.5 param v2cPF taglist TrapPF 
  set maclock enable 

On each interface: 

  set vlan egress 1,2,3 ge.1.xx untagged 
  set port trap ge.1.xx disable 
  set maclock enable ge.1.xx

  set maclock trap ge.1.xx enable 

where `xx` stands for the interface index 

Standalone D2 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

linkUp/linkDown traps are enabled by default so we disable them and enable MAC locking 
only. 

CAUTION: This switch Switch accepts multiple untagged VLAN per port when configured 
through SNMP. This is problematic because on some occasions the untagged VLAN port list 
can become inconsistent with the switch’s running config. To fix that, clear all untagged VLANs 
of a port even if the CLI interface doesn’t show them. 
To do so, use: `clear vlan egress <vlans> <ports>` 

Global config settings

FastIron 4802
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence support this switch with optional VoIP using two different trap types:

* linkUp/linkDown
* Port Security (with static MACs)

*We recommend to enable Port Security only.*

Don't forget to update the startup config!

Those switches support port-security with static MAC address and allow us to secure a MAC on the data VLAN so we enable it whether there is VoIP or not.

We need to secure bogus MAC addresses on ports in order for the switch to send a trap when a new MAC appears on a port.

Global config settings

  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 public
  no snmp-server enable traps link-down
  no snmp-server enable traps link-up

On each interface _without VoIP_:

  int eth xx
    port security
      enable
      maximum 1
      secure 0200.0000.00xx 0
      violation restrict

where `xx` stands for the interface `ifIndex`.

With VoIP a little more work needs to be performed. Instead of the no-VoIP, put in the following config:

----
conf t
vlan <mac-detection-vlan>
  untagged eth xx
vlan <voice-vlan>
  tagged eth xx

int eth xx
  dual-mode <mac-detection-vlan>
  port security
    maximum 2
    secure 0200.00xx.xxxx <mac-detection-vlan>
    secure 0200.01xx.xxxx <voice-vlan>
    violation restrict
    enable
----

where `xxxxxx` stands for the interface number (filled with zeros), `<voice-vlan>` with your voice-VLAN number and `<mac-detection-vlan>` with your mac-detection VLAN number.

E4800G and E5500G Switch series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These are re-branded 3Com switches, see under the <<_3com,3Com section>> for their documentation.

HP ProCurve
~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence supports ProCurve switches _without VoIP_ using two different trap types:

* linkUp/linkDown
* Port Security (with static MACs)

*We recommend to enable Port Security only.*

Don't forget to update the startup config!

NOTE: HP ProCurve only sends one security trap to PacketFence per security violation so make sure PacketFence runs when you configure port-security. Also, because of the above limitation, it is considered good practice to reset the intrusion flag as a first troubleshooting step.

If you want to learn more about intrusion flag and port-security, please refer to the ProCurve documentation.

CAUTION: If you configure a switch that is already in production be careful that enabling port-security causes active MAC addresses to be automatically added to the intrusion list without a security trap sent to PacketFence. This is undesired because PacketFence will not be notified that it needs to configure the port. As a work-around, unplug clients before activating port-security or remove the intrusion flag after you enabled port-security with: `port-security <port> clear-intrusion-flag`.

2500 Series
^^^^^^^^^^^

linkUp/linkDown traps are enabled by default so we disable them and enable Port Security only.

On 2500's, we need to secure bogus MAC addresses on ports in order for the switch to send a trap when a new MAC appears on a port.

Global config settings:

  snmp-server community "public" Unrestricted
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 "public" Not-INFO
  no snmp-server enable traps link-change 1-26

On each interface: 

  port-security xx learn-mode static action send-alarm mac-address 0200000000xx

where `xx` stands for the interface index

2600 Series and 3400cl Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Port-Security
+++++++++++++

linkUp/linkDown traps are enabled by default so we disable them and enable Port Security only.

On 2600's, we *don't* need to secure bogus MAC addresses on ports in order for the switch to send a trap when a new MAC appears on a port.

Global config settings

  snmp-server community public manager unrestricted
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 "public" Not-INFO
  no snmp-server enable traps link-change 1-26

On each interface: 

  port-security xx learn-mode configured action send-alarm

where `xx` stands for the interface index

MAC Authentication (Firmware > 11.72)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to enable RADIUS mac authentication on the ports, you first need to join the ports to either the registration or the mac detection vlan (as a security measure).

Next, define the RADIUS server host:

   radius-server host 192.168.1.5 key use_stong_secret

Since HP now supports server-group, let's create a group for the MAC authentication.  Another one can be used for management access:

   aaa server-group radius "packetfence" host 192.168.1.5
   aaa server-group radius "management" host 10.0.0.15

Configure the AAA authentication for MAC authentication to use the proper server-group:

   aaa authentication mac-based chap-radius server-group "packetfence"

Finally, enable MAC authentication on all necessary ports:

   aaa port-access mac-based 1-24

Don't forget to permit address moves and the reauth period.  x represents the port index:

   aaa port-access mac-based x addr-moves
   aaa port-access mac-based x reauth-period 14400
   
(Thanks to Jean-Francois Laporte for this contribution)

^^^^

802.1X
++++++

Define the RADIUS server host:

   radius-server host 192.168.1.5 key "useStrongerSecret"
   radius-server host 192.168.1.5 acct-port 1813 key "useStrongerSecret"

Define the SNMP configuration:

   snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 community "public" informs trap-level not-info
   no snmp-server enable traps link-change C1

Configure the server-group:

   aaa server-group radius "packetfence" host 192.168.1.5

Configure authentication:

   aaa authentication port-access eap-radius server-group "packetfence"
   aaa authentication mac-based chap-radius server-group "packetfence"

Configure the port-security:

   port-security C1 learn-mode port-access action send-alarm

Configuration of the port:

   aaa port-access authenticator C1
   aaa port-access authenticator C1 client-limit 1
   aaa port-access authenticator active
   aaa port-access mac-based C1
   aaa port-access mac-based C1 addr-moves
   aaa port-access mac-based C1 reauth-period 14400
   aaa port-access C1 controlled-direction in   

(Thanks to Denis Bonnenfant for this contribution)

4100, 5300, 5400 Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Port-Security
+++++++++++++

linkUp/linkDown traps are enabled by default and we have not found a way yet to disable them so do not forget to declare the trunk ports as uplinks in the switch config file.

On 4100's, we need to secure bogus MAC addresses on ports in order for the switch to send a trap when a new MAC appears on a port. The ports are indexed differently on 4100's: it's based on the number of modules you have in your 4100, each module is indexed with a letter.

Global config settings

  snmp-server community "public" Unrestricted
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 "public" Not-INFO
  no snmp-server enable traps link-change 1-26

You should configure interfaces like this:

  port-security A1 learn-mode static action send-alarm mac-address 020000000001
  ...
  port-security A24 learn-mode static action send-alarm mac-address 020000000024
  port-security B1 learn-mode static action send-alarm mac-address 020000000025
  ...
  port-security B24 learn-mode static action send-alarm mac-address 020000000048
  port-security C1 learn-mode static action send-alarm mac-address 020000000049
  ...

MAC Authentication (with VoIP)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to have MAC Authentication working with VoIP, you need to ensure that the Voice VLAN is tagged on all the port first. You also need to activate lldp notification on all ports that will handle VoIP. 
*Finally, make sure to change the value of the $VOICEVLANAME variable in the Procurve 5400 module's source code.*

RADIUS configuration
  radius-server host 192.168.1.5 key strongKey

MAC Authentication

  aaa port-access mac-based C5-C7
  aaa port-access mac-based C5 addr-limit 2
  aaa port-access mac-based C6 addr-limit 2
  aaa port-access mac-based C7 addr-limit 2
  aaa port-access C5 controlled-direction in
  aaa port-access C6 controlled-direction in
  aaa port-access C7 controlled-direction in

802.1X (with VoIP)
++++++++++++++++++

Same as MAC Authentication, you need to ensure that the Voice VLAN is tagged on all the port first if using 802.1X. You also need to activate lldp notification on all ports that will handle VoIP. 
*Finally, make sure to change the value of the $VOICEVLANAME variable in the Procurve 5400 module's source code.*

RADIUS configuration

  radius-server host 192.168.1.5 key strongKey

802.1X

~~~~~~~~~~~

PacketFence supports iPECS series switches _without VoIP_ using two different trap types:

* linkUp / linkDown
* Port Security (with static MACs)

On some recent models, we can also use more secure and robust features, like:

* MAC Authentication
* 802.1X

ES-4500G Series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LinkUp / LinkDown
+++++++++++++++++

Firmware 1.2.3.2 is required for linkUp / linkDown

Prior to config, make sure to create all necessaries VLANs and config the appropriate uplink port.

Global config settings

  snmp-server community public ro
  snmp-server community private rw
  !
  snmp-server enable traps authentication
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 public version 2c udp-port 162
  snmp-server notify-filter traphost.192.168.1.5.public remote 192.168.1.5

Firmware is kinda buggy so you'll need to enable linkUp / linkDown using the Web Interface under *Administration -> SNMP*.

Some reports shows that the switch doesn't always send linkDown traps.

On each interface (except uplink)

  switchport allowed vlan add 4 untagged
  switchport native vlan 4
  switchport allowed vlan remove 1
  switchport mode access

Port-Security
+++++++++++++

Firmware 1.2.3.2 is required for port-security.

Prior to config, make sure to create all necessaries VLANs and config the appropriate uplink port.

Global config settings

  snmp-server community public ro
  snmp-server community private rw
  !
  snmp-server enable traps authentication
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 public version 2c udp-port 162
  snmp-server notify-filter traphost.192.168.1.5.public remote 192.168.1.5

On each interface (except uplink)

  port security max-mac-count 1
  port security
  port security action trap
  switchport allowed vlan add 2 untagged
  switchport native vlan 2
  switchport allowed vlan remove 1
  switchport mode access

The above _port security_ command may not work using the CLI. In this case, use the Web Interface under the *Security -> Port Security* menu and enable each ports using the checkboxes.

It is also recommended, when using port-security, to disable link-change (UP / DOWN) traps.

Don't forget to update the startup config!

Linksys
~~~~~~~

PacketFence supports Linksys switches _without VoIP_ using one trap type:

* linkUp/linkDown

Don't forget to update the startup config!

SRW224G4
^^^^^^^^

Global config settings

  no snmp-server trap authentication
  snmp-server community CS_2000_le rw view Default 
  snmp-server community CS_2000_ls ro view Default 
  snmp-server host 192.168.1.5 public 2

On each interface

  switchport access vlan 4

Netgear
~~~~~~~

The "web-managed smart switch" models GS108Tv2/GS110/GS110TP are supported with Link up/down traps only.

Higher-end "fully managed" switches including FSM726v1 are supported in Port Security mode.

FSM726 / FSM726S version 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence supports FSM726 / FSM726S version 1 switches _without VoIP_ in Port Security mode (with static MACs) – called Trusted MAC table on Netgear's hardware.

Using the HTTP GUI, follow the steps below to configure such feature. Of course, you must create all your VLANs on the switch as well.

[float]
SNMP Settings
+++++++++++++

In *Advanced -> SNMP -> Community Table*, create a read-write community string and a trap community string. You can use the same community for all the 3 functions (Get, Set, Trap).
  
Next, under *Advanced -> SNMP -> Host Table*, enable the Host Authorization feature and add the PacketFence server into the allowed host list.

Finally, under *Advanced -> SNMP -> Trap Setting*, enable the authentication trap.

[float]
Trusted MAC Security
++++++++++++++++++++

Under *Advanced -> Advanced Security -> Trusted MAC Address*, create a fake MAC address per port (ie. 02:00:00:00:00:xx where `xx` is the port number). This will have the effect of sending a security trap to PacketFence when a new device plugs on the port.
  
Don't forget to save the configuration!

GS108Tv2 / GS110T / GS110TP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PacketFence supports certain lower-end Netgear switches in Link Up/Link Down traps. These "web-managed" switches have no command-line interface and only a subset of the port security and 802.1X functionnality needed to interoperate with PacketFence in these more advanced modes. There is no way to send a trap upon port security violation, and there is only pure 802.1X, no MAC Address Bypass.

[float]
Switch Configuration
++++++++++++++++++++

It can be difficult to find the advanced features in the web GUI. We recommend using the GUI "Maintenance" tab to Upload the configuration to a file, and then edit it there.

Hints on file upload/download:

From the File Type menu, choose Text Configuration.

If you're uploading to the TFTP root directory, leave Path blank.

At the top of the config file, you need:

  vlan database
  vlan 1,2,3,4,5
  vlan name 1 "Normal"
  vlan name 2 "Registration"
  vlan name 3 "Isolation"
  vlan name 4 "MAC Detection"
  vlan name 5 "Guest"
  exit

In the same section as "users passwd", you need to specify your PacketFence server's management address:

  snmptrap useStrongerSecret ipaddr 192.168.1.5

In the same section as the "voip oui" lines, you need to allow your SNMP server:

  snmp-server community "public"
  snmp-server community rw useStrongerSecret
  snmp-server community ipaddr 192.168.1.5 public
  snmp-server community ipmask 255.255.255.0 public
  snmp-server community ipaddr 192.168.1.5 useStrongerSecret
  snmp-server community ipmask 255.255.255.0 useStrongerSecret
  no voip vlan

You should use port 1 as the uplink. If you connect port 1 of a GS108Tv2 switch into a Power over Ethernet switch, then the GS108Tv2 does not need AC power. If you bought GS110T(P) switches, presumably it's for the SFP uplink option. You'll want to configure both port 1 and the SFP ports 9-10 as trunks:

  interface 0/1
  no snmp trap link-status
  ip dhcp filtering trust
  vlan pvid 1
  vlan ingressfilter
  vlan participation include 1,2,3,4,5
  vlan tagging 2,3,4,5
  no auto-voip
  exit

Each user-facing, PacketFence-managed port should be configured like:

  interface 0/2
  vlan pvid 4
  vlan ingressfilter
  vlan participation include 4
  no auto-voip
  exit

M Series

PacketFence supports the Netgear M series in wired MAC authentication without VoIP.

* Mac Security

Don't forget to update the startup config!

NOTE: if you are using a 5500 series with a firmware version of 6 or above, you must use a different module called Nortel::BayStack5500_6x in your `/usr/local/pf/conf/switches.conf`. Indeed, Nortel introduced an incompatible change of behavior in this firmware.

Wireless Controllers and Access Point Configuration
---------------------------------------------------

Assumptions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Throughout this configuration example we use the following assumptions for our network infrastructure:

[options="compact"]
* PacketFence is fully configured with FreeRADIUS running
* PacketFence IP address: 192.168.1.5
* Normal VLAN: 1
* Registration VLAN: 2
* Isolation VLAN: 3
* MAC Detection VLAN: 4
* Guest VLAN: 5
* VoIP, Voice VLAN: 100
* use SNMP v2c
* SNMP community name: public
* RADIUS Secret: useStrongerSecret footnote:[Be careful to change the secret key to a much stronger one. A 16 character random secret with digits, upper case and lower case characters is recommended.]
* Open SSID: PacketFence-Public
* WPA-Enterprise SSID: PacketFence-Secure


Unsupported Equipment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wireless network access configuration is a lot more consistent between vendors. This is due to the fact that the situation is a lot more standardized than the wired side: VLAN assignment is done centrally with RADIUS and that the client protocol is consistent (MAC-Authentication or 802.1X).

This consistency has the benefit that a lot of the wireless network devices tend to work out-of-the-box with PacketFence. The only missing piece being, in most cases, remote deauthentication of the client which is used for VLAN assignment (deauth user so it'll reconnect and get new VLAN).

So, even if your wireless equipment is not explicitly supported by PacketFence, it's recommended that you give it a try. The next section covers the objectives that you want to accomplish for trying out your equipment even if we don't have configuration for it.

Here are the high-level requirements for proper wireless integration with PacketFence

* The appropriate VLANs must exist
* Allow controller to honor VLAN assignments from AAA (sometimes called AAA override)
* Put your open SSID (if any) in MAC-Authentication mode and authenticate against the FreeRADIUS hosted on PacketFence
* Put your secure SSID (if any) in 802.1X mode and authenticate against FreeRADIUS hosted on PacketFence.
* On registration / isolation VLANs the DHCP traffic must reach the PacketFence server
* On your production VLANs a copy of the DHCP traffic must reach PacketFence where a pfdhcplistener listens (configurable in `pf.conf` under `interfaces`)

At this point, user registration with the captive-portal is possible and registered users should have access to the appropriate VLANs. However, VLAN changes (like after a registration) won't automatically happen, you will need to disconnect / reconnect. An explanation is provided in introduction section above about this behavior.

You can try modules similar to your equipment if any (read appropriate instructions) or you can try to see if RFC3576 is supported. RFC3576 covers RADIUS Packet of Disconnect (PoD) also known as Disconnect Messages (DM) or Change of Authorization (CoA). You can try the Aruba module if you want to verify if RFC3576 is supported by your hardware.

If none of the above worked then you can fallback to inline enforcement or let us know what equipment you are using on the https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/packetfence-devel[packetfence-devel mailing list].

AeroHIVE
~~~~~~~~

AeroHIVE products are a bit different compared to the other vendors. They support either a local HiveManager (kind of wireless controller) or a cloud-based HVM. However, the configuration is the same for the local and the cloud-based controller. Note that all the config are made on the HVM and then pushed to the APs. 

[float]
AAA Client Settings
+++++++++++++++++++

In the HVM, go to *Configuration -> AAA Authentication -> AAA Client Settings*, and insert the proper properties:

* Give a RADIUS Name
* Add a RADIUS server with Authentication as the server type and primary as the role
* Make sure Permit Dynamic Change of Authorization is ticked (RFC 3576)

[float]
Public SSID
++++++++++++

Again in the HVM, go to *Configuration -> SSIDs*, and create a new SSID with the following:

* Give a Profile Name and an SSID Name
* Choose Open as the Access Security 
* Select Enable Mac Authentication
* Select your RADIUS server from the RADIUS Server dropdown list

[float]
Secure SSID
++++++++++++

In the HVM, go to *Configuration -> SSIDs*, and create a new SSID with the following :

* Give a Profile Name and an SSID Name
* Choose WPA2 Enterprise as the Access Security 
* Select WPA2-802.1X as the key management
* Select CCMP as the encryption method
* Select your RADIUS server from the RADIUS Server dropdown list

[float]
Roles (User Profiles)
+++++++++++++++++++++

Since PacketFence 3.3.0, we now support user profiles on the AeroHIVE hardware.  To build a User Profile, go to *Configuration -> User Profiles*, and create what you need.  When you define the switch
definition in PacketFence, the role will match the User Profile attribute number.  Example

   roles=CategoryStudent=1;CategoryStaff=2

And in the AeroHIVE configuration, you have :

   StudentProfile attribute number 1
   StaffProfile attribute number 2

Last step is to allow the User Profile to be returned for a particular SSID.  Go to *Configuration -> SSIDs -> Your_SSID -> User Profiles for Traffic Management*, and select the User Profiles you will
return for the devices.

NOTE: The VLAN ID is *NOT* returned by PacketFence if a role is available for a given category.   The VLAN ID needs to be configured in the User Profile definition on the AeroHIVE side.

[float]
Caching and Roaming
++++++++++++++++++++

AeroHIVE have a session replication feature to ease the EAP session roaming between two access points. However, this may cause problems when you bounce the wireless card of a client, it will not do a new RADIUS request. Two settings can be tweaked to reduce the caching impact, it is the roaming cache update interval and roaming cache ageout. They are located in *Configuration -> SSIDs -> [SSID Name] -> Optional Settings -> Advanced*.
The other way to support Roaming is to enable snmp trap in the AeroHIVE configuration to PacketFence server. PacketFence will recognise the ahConnectionChangeEvent and will change the location of the node in his base.

[float]
External captive portal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First configure the AAA server as described in the section above in the Hive Manager.

Portal configuration
++++++++++++++++++++
* Go in *Configuration -> Authentication -> Captive Web Portals* and create a new portal
* Select Select *Registration Type* = *External Authentication*
* Go in the section *Captive Web Portal Login Page Settings* set the *Login URL* to http://pf_ip/ and *Password Encryption* to *No Encryption*

////

This option is currently broken but will be needed so it redirects the user at the end of the authentication.
* Go in the section * Captive Web Portal Success Page Settings* and check *Redirect to the initially requested page* at the bottom.

////

[float]
External portal SSID
++++++++++++++++++++

Again in the Hive Manager, go to *Configuration -> SSIDs*, and create a new SSID with the following:

* Give a Profile Name and an SSID Name
* Choose Open as the Access Security 
* Select Enable Captive Web Portal
* Select your RADIUS server from the RADIUS Server dropdown list

In the guided configuration you now be able to select your new SSID, the Portal you want to use and the AAA server.

Anyfi
~~~~~

In this section, we cover the basic configuration of the Anyfi Gateway to create a hotspot SSID available on all access points.

This does not cover the configuration of other Anyfi network elements such as the Controller. Please refer to http://www.anyfinetworks.com/resources[Anyfi Networks' website] for relevant documentation.

In this configuration eth0 will be the management interface of the Anyfi Gateway and eth1 will be the interface that will bridge the tagged packets to your network.

Interfaces configuration

  interfaces {
      bridge br0 {
          ...
      }
      ethernet eth0 {
          description "Management network"
          address 192.168.0.20/24

          bridge-group {
              bridge br0
          }
      }
  }

MAC authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section will allow you to configure the 'Anyfi-Hotspot' SSID that will use MAC authentication.

SSID configuration
++++++++++++++++++

  service {
      anyfi {
          gateway anyfi-hotspot {
              accounting {
                  radius-server 192.168.0.5 {
                      port 1813
                      secret useStrongerSecret
                  }
              }
              authorization {
                  radius-server 192.168.0.5 {
                      port 1812
                      secret useStrongerSecret
                  }
              }
              bridge br0
              controller <Anyfi Controller's IP or FQDN>
              isolation
              nas {
                  identifier anyfi
                  port 3799
              }
              ssid Anyfi-Hotspot
          }
      }
  }

802.1X
^^^^^^

This section will allow you to configure the 'Anyfi-Secure' SSID that will authenticate users using 802.1X.

SSID configuration
++++++++++++++++++
  service {
      anyfi {
          gateway secure-gw {
              accounting {
                  radius-server 192.168.0.5 {

All Aruba OS
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section, we cover the basic configuration of the Aruba wireless controller for PacketFence via the web GUI. It was done on an Aruba Controller 200 software version ArubaOS 5.0.3.3, tested on a Controller 600 with ArubaOS 6.0 but it should apply to all Aruba models.

CAUTION: If you are already using your Aruba controllers and don't want to impact your users you should create new AAA profiles and apply them to new SSIDs instead of modifying the default ones.

NOTE: Starting with PacketFence 3.3, Aruba supports role-based access control. Read the Administration Guide under "Role-based enforcement support" for more information about how to configure it on the PacketFence side.

[float]
AAA Settings
+++++++++++++

In the Web interface, go to *Configuration -> Authentication -> RADIUS Server* and add a RADIUS server named "packetfence" then edit it:

* Set Host to PacketFence's IP (192.168.1.5)
* Set the Key to your RADIUS shared secret (useStrongerSecret)
* Click Apply

Under *Configuration -> Authentication -> Server Group* add a new Server Group named "packetfence" then edit it to add your RADIUS Server "packetfence" to the group. Click Apply.

Under *Configuration -> Authentication -> RFC3576* add a new server with PacketFence's IP (192.168.1.5) and your RADIUS shared secret (useStrongerSecret). Click Apply.
Under *Configuration -> Authentication -> L2 Authentication* edit the MAC Authentication Profile called "default" then edit it to change the Delimiter to dash. Click Apply.

Under *Configuration -> Authentication -> L2 Authentication* edit the 802.1X Authentication Profile called "default" then edit it to uncheck the Opportunistic Key Caching under Advanced. Click Apply.

Under *Configuration -> Authentication -> AAA Profiles* click on the "default-mac-auth" profile then click on MAC Authentication Server Group and choose the "packetfence" server group. Click Apply. Move to the RFC3576 server sub item and choose PacketFence's IP (192.168.1.5) click add then apply.

Under *Configuration -> Authentication -> AAA Profiles* click on the "default-dot1x" profile then click on 802.1X Authentication Server Group and choose the "packetfence" server group. Click Apply. Move to the RFC3576 server sub item and choose PacketFence's IP (192.168.1.5) click add then apply.

[float]
Public SSID
++++++++++++

In the Web interface, go to *Configuration -> AP Configuration* then edit the "default" AP Group. Go in *Wireless LAN -> Virtual AP* create a new profile with the following:

* AAA Profile: default-mac-auth
* SSID Profile: Select NEW then add an SSID (PacketFence-Public) and Network authentication set to None

[float]
Secure SSID
+++++++++++

In the Web interface, go to *Configuration -> AP Configuration* then edit the "default" AP Group. Go in *Wireless LAN -> Virtual AP* create a new profile with the following:

* AAA Profile: default-dot1x
* SSID Profile: Select NEW then add an SSID (PacketFence-Secure) and Network authentication set to WPA2

[float]
Roles
+++++

Since PacketFence 3.3.0, we now support roles for the Aruba hardware.  To add roles, go in *Configuration -> Access Control -> User Roles -> Add*.  You don't need to force a VLAN usage in the Role
since we send also the VLAN ID along with the Aruba User Role in the RADIUS request.  Refer to the Aruba User Guide for more information about the Role creation.

WIPS
++++

In order to use the WIPS feature in PacketFence, please follow those simple steps to send the traps to PacketFence.

First, configure PacketFence to be a trap receiver.  Under *Configuration > SNMP > Trap Receivers*, add an entry for the PF management IP.  By default, all traps will be enabled.  If you want to disable some, you will need
to connect via CLI, and run the *snmp-server trap disable <trapname>* command.

Aruba Controller 200
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section, we cover the basic configuration of the Aruba Controller 200 for PacketFence using the command line interface. We suggest you to use the instructions above for the Web GUI instead.

[float]
VLAN definition
+++++++++++++++

Here, we create our PacketFence VLANs, and our AccessPoint VLAN (VID 66). It is recommended to isolate the management of the thin APs in a separate VLAN. 

  vlan 2 
  vlan 3 
  vlan 5 
  vlan 10 
  vlan 66

All Aruba Instant OS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Add your packetfence instance to your configuration:

wlan auth-server packetfence

  ip 192.168.1.5
  port 1812
  acctport 1813
  timeout 10
  retry-count 5
  key useStrongerSecret
  nas-ip [Aruba Virtual Controller IP]
  rfc3576


Add dynamic vlan rules and mac auth to your ssid profile:

wlan ssid-profile SSID

  index 0 
  type employee
  essid ESSID
  wpa-passphrase WPA-Passphrase
  opmode wpa2-psk-aes
  max-authentication-failures 0
  vlan 1

  inactivity-timeout 1000
  broadcast-filter none
  radius-reauth-interval 5
  dmo-channel-utilization-threshold 90

Belair Networks (now Ericsson)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BE20
^^^^

The Belair Networks BE20s are fairly easy to configure.

Add VLANs
+++++++++

On the BE20 Web Interface, click on *Eth-1-1*.  By default, there will be nothing in there.  You need to first create an untagged VLAN (VLAN 0). In order to do that, you need to set
the PVID, Reverse PVID, and the VLAN field to 0.  Then click add.

Repeat that step for each of your VLANs by entering the proper VLAN ID in the VLAN field.
   
AAA Servers
+++++++++++

Once you have the VLANs setup, you need to add PacketFence into the AAA Server list.  Go to *System -> Radius Servers*.  Click on *Add server*, and fill out the proper information.

* Ensure the Enabled checkbox is selected
* IP Address: Insert the IP Address of the PacketFence Management Interface
* Shared Secret: Insert the shared secret for RADIUS communication

When done, click on the *Apply* button.

Secure SSID
+++++++++++
Since the BE20 doesn't support Open SSID with Mac Authentication, we will only describe how to configure a WPA2-Enterprise SSID.  First, we will configure the 5GHz antenna.

Click on *Wifi-1-1 -> Access SSID Config*.  From the *Configuration for SSID* dropdown, select the 1 entry.  Modify the fields like the following:

* SSID: Put your SSID Name you would like
* Type: Broadcast
* Use Privacy Mode: WPA2(AES) with EAP/DOT1x
* RADIUS NAS Identifier: You can put a string to identify your AP
* Radius Accounting Enabled: Checkbox Selected
* Radius Station ID Delimiter: dash
* Radius StationId Append Ssid: Checkbox Selected
* RADIUS Server 1: Select the AAA Server you created earlier

When done click *Apply*.  Repeat the same configuration for the 2.4GHz Antenna (Wifi-1-2).

That should conclude the configuration.  You can now save the configs to the flash by hitting the *Config Save* button on top of the Interface.

Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) or Wireless Services Module (WiSM)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section, we cover the basic configuration of the WiSM for PacketFence using the web interface.

* First, globally define the FreeRADIUS server running on PacketFence
  (PacketFence's IP) and make sure _Support for RFC 3576_ is enabled (if not present it is enabled by default)

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-radius-define.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Freeradius server"]

* Then we create two SSIDs:
[options="compact"]
** PacketFence-Public: non-secure with MAC authentication only
** PacketFence-Secure: secure with WPA2 Enterprise PEAP/MSCHAPv2

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-ssid-create.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID creation"]

* In the secure SSID, make sure 802.1X is enabled and select the appropriate encryption for your needs (recommended: WPA + WPA2)

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-l2-secu.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID L2 secure"]

* No layer 3 security

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-l3-secu.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID L3 secure"]

* We set the IP of the FreeRADIUS server

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-secure-radius.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Radius secure"]

* VERY IMPORTANT: Allow AAA override (this allows VLAN assignment from RADIUS)

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-secure-radius-advance.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Radius advanced secure"]

* Edit the non-secure SSID: Enable MAC authentication at level 2

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-l2-non-secure.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID L2 non secure"]

* Nothing at level 3

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-l3-non-secure.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID L3 non secure"]

* We set the IP of the FreeRADIUS server

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-secure-radius.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Radius secure"]

* VERY IMPORTANT: Allow AAA override (this allows VLAN assignment from RADIUS)

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-non-secure-radius-advance.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Radius advanced non secure"]

* Finally, in _Controller > Interfaces_ tab, create an interface per VLAN that could assigned

image::docs/images/cisco-wlc-interface-ssid.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID Interface"]

You are good to go!

Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Web Auth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, we cover the basic configuration of the WLC Web Auth for PacketFence using the web interface.
The idea is to forward the device to the captive portal with an ACL if the device is in an unreg state and 
allow the device to reach Internet (or the normal network) by changing the ACL once registered.
In the unreg state, the WLC will intercept the HTTP traffic and forward the device to the captive portal.

In this sample configuration, the captive portal uses the IP address 172.16.0.250, the administration interface
uses the IP address 172.16.0.249 and the WLC uses the IP address 172.16.0.248.
The DHCP and DNS servers are not managed by PacketFence (WLC DHCP Server, Production DHCP Server)

* First, globally define the FreeRADIUS server running on PacketFence
  (PacketFence's Administration Interface) and make sure _Support for RFC 3576_ is enabled (if not present it is enabled by default)

* Then we create a SSID:
[options="compact"]
** OPEN SSID: non-secure with MAC authentication only

image::docs/images/SSID_1.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 1"]

image::docs/images/SSID_2.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 2"]

image::docs/images/SSID_3.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 3"]

image::docs/images/SSID_4.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 4"]

image::docs/images/SSID_5.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 5"]

image::docs/images/SSID_6.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 6"]

image::docs/images/SSID_7.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="SSID step 7"]

* Then you have to create two ACLs - one to deny all traffic except the required one to hit the portal (Pre-Auth-For-WebRedirect ) and the other
one to allow anything (Authorize_any) .

image::docs/images/ACL.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="ACL"]

* Then the last step is to configure the WLC in PacketFence.
Portal URL definition

Role definition

image::docs/images/WLC_PACKETFENCE2.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="ACL"]

Troubleshooting ignored RADIUS replies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the event the WLC ignores the RADIUS replies from PacketFence (you receive multiple requests but access is never granted), validate the following elements : 
* RADIUS secret is properly configured in PacketFence and the WLC controller.
* The SSL certificate used by PacketFence is not expired.

Extricom
~~~~~~~~

EXSW Wireless Switches (Controllers)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to have the Extricom controller working with PacketFence, you need to define two ESSID definition, one for the "public" network, and one for the "secure" network. This can be done under a very short time period since Extricom supports RADIUS assigned VLANs out of the box.

You first need to configure you RADIUS server. This is done under the: *WLAN Settings -> RADIUS* tab. Enter the PacketFence RADIUS server information. For the ESSID configuration. in the administration UI, go to *WLAN Settings -> ESSID definitions*. Create the profiles per the following:

[float]
Public SSID
+++++++++++

* MAC Authentication must be ticked
* Encryption method needs to be set to None
* Select PacketFence as the MAC Authentication RADIUS server (previously added)

[float]
Secure SSID
+++++++++++

* Encryption method needs to be set to WPA Enterprise/WPA2 Enterprise
* AES only needs to be selected
* Select PacketFence as the RADIUS server (previously added)

The final step is to enable SNMP Agent and SNMP Traps on the controller. This is done under the following tab in the administrative UI: *Advanced -> SNMP*.

Hostapd
~~~~~~~

OpenWRT
^^^^^^^

In this section, we cover the basic configuration of the OpenWRT access point (Hostapd software).
Hostapd must have been compiled with dynamic vlan support and you need to create a file /etc/config/hostapd.vlan that contain:

  *           wlan0.#

And you need to replace the /lib/wifi/hostapd.sh script file with the one included in /usr/local/pf/addons/hostapd

[float]
Open SSID
+++++++++

Configure your SSID using uci command:

  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0]=wifi-iface
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].device=radio0
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].mode=ap
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].ssid=OpenWrt-OPEN
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].network=lan
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].encryption=none
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].auth_server=192.168.1.5
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].auth_port=1812
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].auth_secret=useStrongerSecret
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].dynamic_vlan=2
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].vlan_file=/etc/config/hostapd.vlan
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].vlan_tagged_interface=eth0
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].radius_das_port=3799
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].radius_das_client='192.168.1.5 useStrongerSecret'
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].macfilter=2

[float]
Secure SSID
+++++++++++

Configure your SSID using uci command:

  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0]=wifi-iface
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].device=radio0
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].mode=ap
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].ssid=OpenWrt-SECURE
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].network=lan
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].auth_server=192.168.1.5
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].auth_port=1812
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].auth_secret=useStrongerSecret
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].dynamic_vlan=2
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].vlan_file=/etc/config/hostapd.vlan
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].vlan_tagged_interface=eth0
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].radius_das_port=3799
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].radius_das_client='192.168.1.5 useStrongerSecret'
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].encryption=wpa2
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].acct_server=192.168.1.5
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].acct_port=1813
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].acct_secret=s3cr3t
  uci add_list wireless.@wifi-iface[0].nasid=ubiquiti

Then launch 'uci commit wireless' and 'wifi' command to enable your configuration

Hostapd (software)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To configure Hostapd software you can use the same configuration parameters above in the configuration file.

Meraki
~~~~~~

In this section, we will cover the configuration of the Meraki controller to use Web authentication.

CAUTION: There is currently no way to reevaluate the access of the device using PacketFence. This means that there is no real-time action when trying to isolate a device. The RADIUS reauthentication delay will determine the maximum response time of the access reevaluation.

First create a new SSID and then edit its settings.

Configure it as seen in the screenshot below.

image::docs/images/meraki-radius-config.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="RADIUS configuration"]

NOTE: Make sure to configure your RADIUS server so it's accessible externally under a domain name or a public IP address. Replace `pf.domain.net` by what you will configure. The only port needed is 1812 in UDP. Refer to the Meraki documentation for more details.

Next, just below, configure the options for the users access as shown in the screenshot below.

image::docs/images/meraki-network-config.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Network configuration"]

Where 192.168.1.5 is the IP address of your PacketFence server.

NOTE: Make sure you select bridge mode so your users are not NATed through your AP. If you need the devices to be on another VLAN, modify the VLAN tagging of the SSID.

Next go in *Wireless->Configure->Splash page*. Select the *Custom splash URL* and configure the URL pointing to your PacketFence server.

image::docs/images/meraki-splash-config.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Splash page configuration"]

NOTE: Even if you enabled the bridge mode on the access point, it will still send a NATed IP address during the initial HTTP request. To workaround this you will need to forward the DHCP traffic of the network your nodes are connected to so PacketFence has the proper IP information of the devices.

Mikrotik
~~~~~~~~

This configuration has been tested on Access Point OmniTIK U-5hnD with RouterOS v6.18 and only MAC-Authentication is available now.
The only deauthentication method available is SSH, so create an account in the Mikrotik AP and fill the information in PacketFence switch configuration.
Also don't forget to use the pf account to ssh on the Access Point to receive the ssh key.

[float]
Open SSID
+++++++++

In this setup we use the interface ether5 for the bridge (Trunk interface) and ether1 as the management interface.

Configure your access point with the following configuration:

  /interface wireless
  # managed by CAPsMAN

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section, we cover the basic configuration of the Meru wireless controller for PacketFence via the web GUI.

[float]
Disable PMK Caching
+++++++++++++++++++

If you are running a WPA2 SSID, you may need to disable PMK caching in order to avoid deauthentication issues.  This is true if you are running AP 300s using any 5.0 versions including 5.0-87, or any versions below 4.0-160.

Here are the commands to run to disable the PMK caching at the AP level.  First, login the AP, and run this command to see which radios are broadcasting your SSID.
   vap display

Second, disable the PMK caching on those radios.
   radio pmkid radio00 disable

You can also add those commands to the AP bootscript.  Contact your Meru support representative for that part.

[float]
VLAN Definition
+++++++++++++++

Here, we create our PacketFence VLANs for client use. Go to *Configuration -> Wired -> VLAN*, and select Add.

* VLAN Name is the human readable name (ie. RegistrationVLAN)
* Tag is the VLAN ID
* Fast Ethernet Interface Index refers to the controller's ethernet interface
* IP Address – An IP address for this controller on this VLAN
* Netmask – Network mask for this VLAN
* IP Address of the default gateway – Wired IP router for this VLAN
* Set the Override Default DHCP server flag to off
* Leave the DHCP server IP address and the DHCP relay Pass-Through to default

Under *Configuration -> Wireless -> ESS*, select the SSID you want to add to your aps. Then, select the *ESS-AP Table*, and click *Add*.

* Select the AP ID from the drop down list
* Click *OK* to associate the SSID with this AP

[float]
Roles (Per-User Firewall)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Since PacketFence 3.3.0, we now support roles (per-user firwall rules) for the Meru hardware.  To add firewall rules, go in *Configuration -> QoS System Settings -> QoS and Firewall Rules*.  When you add a rule, you have to pay attention to two things:

* The rule is applied to the controller physical interface right away, so make sure you are not too wide on your ACL to lock you out!
* The rules are grouped using the Firewall Filter ID (We will use this ID for the roles)

So, since the matching is done using the Firewall Filter ID configuration field, your roles line in switches.conf would look like :

   roles=Guests=1;Staff=2

NOTE: You need to have the *Per-User Firewall* license in order to benefit this feature.

Motorola
~~~~~~~~

In order to have the Motorola RFS controller working with PacketFence, you
need to define two Wireless LANs definition, one for the "public" network,
and one for the "secure" network.

WiNG (Firmware >= 5.0)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[float]
AAA Policy (RADIUS server)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

First, we need to build the AAA Policy. Under *Configuration -> Wireless -> AAA Policy*, click on the *Add* button at the bottom right. Configure the RADIUS profile like the following:

* Host: Choose IP Address in the drop down, and put the RADIUS server (PF) IP
* Insert a RADIUS secret passphrase
* Select "Through Wireless Controller" Request Mode

CAUTION: Since we are using RADIUS Dynamic Authorization, we need to enable the RADIUS accounting. Under the RADIUS accounting tab, click the Add button at the bottom right, and insert the proper values.

[float]
Open SSID
+++++++++

Under *Configuration -> Wireless -> Wireless LANs*, click on the *Add* button at the bottom right. Under Basic Configuration:

* Profile Name : Give a convenient name

* Unselect everything under Fast Roaming (Disable caching)

.Accounting configuration:
* Make sure you select "Enable RADIUS Accounting"
* Select the previously configured AAA Policy

.Advanced configuration:
* Make sure you select RADIUS Dynamic Authorization

[float]
Profile (WLAN Mapping)
++++++++++++++++++++++

You have multiple options here. Either, you create a general AP profile, and you assign it to your Aps, or you modify the AP device configuration to map the WLAN to the radio interfaces. For the purpose of this document, we will modify the general profile. Under *Profiles -> default-apXXX* (where XXX is your AP model), in *Interface -> Radios*, edit the existing radios settings. Go to the *WLAN Mapping* tab, select the two SSIDs and click on the *<<* button.

[float]
Profile (Management)
++++++++++++++++++++

Here, we can configure our SNMP community strings. Located in *Configuration -> Management -> Management Policy*. Again, you can modify the default one, or you can create a brand new Policy.

[float]
VLANs
+++++

You need to ensure that the uplink interface of the controller is configured as a trunk, and that all the necessary VLANs are created on the device. This is configured under *Device -> rfsXXXX-MAC* (where XXXX is your controller series, and MAC is the latest 3 octets of its mac address). Edit the device configuration, and go to *Interface -> Ethernet Ports*. Ensure that the up1 interface is set as trunk, with all the allowed VLANs. Next, create the VLAN under *Interface -> Virtual Interfaces*.

[float]
Roles (Per-User Firewall)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Since PacketFence 3.3.0, we now support roles for the Motorola hardware using WiNGS 5.x.  To add roles, go in *Configuration -> Security -> Wireless Client Roles*.  First create a global policy that
will contain your roles.  Next, create your Roles by clicking on the *Add* button on the bottom right.  It is important to configure the Group Configuration line properly by setting the string
name that we will use in the RADIUS packet.  For exemple, for a Guests Role, you can put *Group Configuration Exact Guests*, and for a Staff Roles, you can put *Group Configuration Exact Staff*. 
In the roles configuration in switches.conf, you would have something like :

   roles=CategoryGuests=Guests;CategoryStaff=Staff

Finally, don't forget to configure the appropriate firewall rules for your Roles!  Make sure also to commit the configuration upon your changes.

NOTE: You need to have an *Advanced Security* license to enable the Per-User Firewall feature.

WIPS
++++

In order to enable the WIPS functionality on the Motorola, you need to follow this procedure.  The steps have been done using the CLI.

First, Create a wips-policy:

   wips-policy Rogue-AP
   history-throttle-duration 86400
   event ap-anomaly airjack
   event ap-anomaly null-probe-response
   event ap-anomaly asleap
   event ap-anomaly ad-hoc-violation
   event ap-anomaly ap-ssid-broadcast-in-beacon
   event ap-anomaly impersonation-attack
   ap-detection

Next, create an event policy:

   event-system-policy PF-WIDS
   event wips wips-event syslog off snmp on forward-to-switch off email off

Next, create or adjust your management policy to configure the SNMP traps.  Here is an example policy, please note the two last lines:

   management-policy default
   no http server
   https server
   ssh
   user admin password 1 e4c93663e3356787d451312eeb8d4704ef09f2331a20133764c3dc3121f13a5b role superuser access all
   user operator password 1 7c9b1fbb2ed7d5bb50dba0b563eac722b0676b45fed726d3e4e563b0c87d236d role monitor access all
   no snmp-server manager v3
   snmp-server community public ro
   snmp-server community private rw
   snmp-server user snmpoperator v3 encrypted des auth md5 0 operator
   snmp-server user snmptrap v3 encrypted des auth md5 0 motorola
   snmp-server user snmpmanager v3 encrypted des auth md5 0 motorola
   snmp-server enable traps
   snmp-server host 10.0.0.100 v2c 162

You then need to tell your controller to use the event policy:

   rfs6000 5C-0E-8B-17-F2-E3
   ...
   use event-system-policy PF-WIDS

Finally, you need to configure a radio interface on your AP to act as a sensor.  Here is an example configuration for a dual-radio AP650:

   ap650 00-23-68-86-EB-BC
   use profile default-ap650
   use rf-domain default
   hostname ap650-86EBBC
   country-code ca
   use wips-policy Rogue-AP
   interface radio1
   rf-mode sensor
   channel smart
   power smart
   data-rates default
   no preamble-short
   radio-share-mode off
   interface radio2
   ...

Ruckus
~~~~~~

[float]
AAA Servers
+++++++++++

We need to define the RADIUS and RADIUS accounting (mandatory):

Under *Configuration -> AAA Servers*, click on the *Create New* button.  Enter the proper configuration:

* Enter a server name
* Select either RADIUS or RADIUS accounting as the type
* Use PAP as the Auth Method
* Enter the IP addres, and shared secret.
* Hit OK

Repeat the steps for the RADIUS and RADIUS accounting types.  We need 1 definition for each otherwise RADIUS dynamic authorization won't work.

[float]

* Enter a Name/SSID
* Select *Standard Usage* as the Type
* Select *WPA2* as the authentication type
* Select *AES* as the encryption method
* Select the proper RADIUS server as the authentication server
* Select the proper RADIUS server as the accounting server
* Check the *Enable Dynamic VLAN* checkbox

[float]
WIPS
++++

To enable the WIPS feature of the Ruckus in order to send SNMP traps to PacketFence, the setup is fairly simple.  

First, configure the controller to send the traps to PacketFence.  Under *Configure > System > Network Management > SNMP Trap*:

*Select "Enable SNMP Trap"
*Put the PacketFence Management IP in the Trap Server IP field

NOTE: The traps will arrive with the "public" community string

Next, you need to configure the Alarm Settings.  Under *Configure > Alarm Settings*, make sure the following are selected:

*Rogue AP Detected
*SSID-Spoofing AP Detected
*MAC-Spoofing AP Detected
*LAN Rogue AP Detected

Finally, enable the WIPS feature on the controller.  Under *Configure > WIPS > Intrusion Detection and Prevention*, make sure both box are selected, click Apply. 

Web authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to use PacketFence as an external captive portal for web authentication, you will need to configure first your RADIUS authentication and accounting server (see steps above).

[float]
Hotspot configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++

Configure the Hotspot service profile to redirect devices to your PacketFence portal. Go on the ZoneDirector administration web page to the section *Configure->Hotspot Services->Create New*

image::docs/images/ruckus_hotspot_service.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Hotsport Service"]

 1 - Name of your Hotspot service
 2 - Login Page: Url of Packetfence portal interface (http://192.168.1.5)
 3 - Start Page: redirect to the following URL: http://192.168.1.5
 4 - Authentication Server: Select the PacketFence authentication RADIUS server (default port 1812)
 5 - Accounting Server: Select the PacketFence accounting RADIUS server (default 1813)
 6 - Click on the Walled Garden and authorize the IP of PacketFence management interface

Save your configuration.

[float]
WLAN configuration
++++++++++++++++++

Go to *Configure->WLANs->WLANs->Create New*

image::docs/images/ruckus_create_ssid.png[scaledwidth="100%",alt="Hotsport Service"]

 1 - Name of your SSID
 2 - Type: Hotspot Service (WISPr)
 3 - Authentication Method: Open
 4 - Encryption Method: None
 5 - Hotspot Services: Your hotspot service name that you configured
 6 - Access VLAN: The VLAN ID that should be assigned to devices after authentication

Save your configuration.

[float]
PacketFence configuration
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

On the ZoneDirector configuration in PacketFence, you will need to specify -1 as the registration vlan in order to display the captive portal to the end device. 

You will need to deactivate the force secure redirect on the captive portal under *Configuration->Captive Portal->Secure redirect->Unchecked*

The captive portal needs to listen on the management interface, so you will need to add the portal daemon to the management interface under *Configuration->Interfaces->Management Interface*


Example:

 [interface eth0]
 ip=192.168.1.5
 type=management,portal
 mask=255.255.255.0

To apply the configuration, restart PacketFence using the following command: service packetfence restart

Trapeze
~~~~~~~

In order to have the Trapeze controller working with PacketFence, you need to define the RADIUS configuration and the proper service profiles.

[float]
RADIUS configuration
++++++++++++++++++++

  set radius server PF address 192.168.1.5 timeout 5 retransmit 3 deadtime 0 key secret
  set server group PF-RADIUS members PF

[float]
Service Profiles
++++++++++++++++

Here we define two service profiles, one for the open SSID (PacketFence-Public)
and one for the WPA2-Enterprise SSID (PacketFence-Secure):

----
set service-profile PF-Open ssid-name PacketFence-Public
set service-profile PF-Open ssid-type clear
set service-profile PF-Open auth-fallthru last-resort
set service-profile PF-Open cipher-tkip enable
set service-profile PF-Open auth-dot1x disable
set service-profile PF-Open 11n mode-na required
set service-profile PF-Open attr vlan-name WLAN_REG

set service-profile PF-Secure ssid-name PacketFence-Secure
set service-profile PF-Secure cipher-tkip enable
set service-profile PF-Secure cipher-ccmp enable
set service-profile PF-Secure wpa-ie enable
set service-profile PF-Secure rsn-ie enable
set service-profile PF-Secure 11n mode-na required
set service-profile PF-Secure attr vlan-name Wlan

set radio-profile default service-profile PacketFence-Public
set radio-profile default service-profile PacketFence-Secure
----

[float]
AAA configuration
+++++++++++++++++

Finally, we need to tie the service profiles with the proper AAA configuration.

  set accounting dot1x ssid PacketFence-Secure ** start-stop PF-RADIUS
  set accounting mac ssid PacketFence-Public * start-stop PF-RADIUS
  set authentication mac ssid PacketFence-Public * PF-RADIUS
  set authentication dot1x ssid PacketFence-Secure ** pass-through PF-RADIUS

Xirrus
~~~~~~

Xirrus WiFi Arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Xirrus Access Points can be configured to work with PacketFence quickly since Xirrus supports RADIUS assigned VLANs out of the box.

First, RADIUS server configuration. Set the RADIUS server to be PacketFence's IP: 

  radius-server  ! (global settings)
    !
    external
      primary     server 192.168.1.5
      primary     secret useStrongerSecret
      !
      accounting
        primary   server 192.168.1.5
        primary   secret useStrongerSecret
      exit
    exit
  exit

Enable SNMP Agent on the access point:

  snmp
    !
    v2
      community read-write public
      community read-only public
    exit
    !
  exit

Finally, don't forget to create the SSID you want and the proper bindings with the LAN. Open SSID should be configured to perform MAC Authentication and Secure SSID should be configured to perform 802.1X (WPA-Enterprise or WPA2-Enterprise).

External portal SSID
++++++++++++++++++++
* Set *Encryption / Authentication* to None / Open
* Then check the WPR checkbox
* Then in in the section Web Page Redirect Configuration set *Server* to External Login
* Set the *Redirect URL* to http://192.168.1.5/Xirrus::AP_http
* Set the *Redirect Secret* to any passphrase of your choice
* In the *RADIUS Configuration* section set the RADIUS server to point to your PacketFence server
